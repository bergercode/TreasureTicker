<h1>Earnings Counter App</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Earnings Counter App is a lightweight application designed to help users track multiple incoming and outgoing sources of income, and project their earnings over different time periods. The app provides a real-time ticker/counter that updates based on user-inputted income sources. With this tool, users can add income streams, specify earning frequencies, and view projected earnings for hourly, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, and yearly periods. The timeline for developing this MVP was 1 hour.
